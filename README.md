# Personal Website

This is my personal website where I will advertise a bit about myself. The goal of this project is to build a website that employers can use to learn more about me, and for me to apply my knowledge and skills of Node, Express, HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. 

How it works
- Right now it is completely static, but sitting on a functional Node.js environment/Express framework if I want to make it dynamic in the future.
- Front-end made with Bootstrap and custom HTMl/CSS. 
- Responsive design good for most screen sizes (working on it!)

Cool features I experimented with:
- Smooth scroll(try clicking on an item in the navbar)
- Auto color-changing navbar: turns solid after scrolling away from top
- Full screen responsive first page with disappearing down arrow
- ~~Flipping cards!~~ (removed as they were not very responsive or modular)
