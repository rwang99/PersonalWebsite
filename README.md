# Personal Website

This is my personal website where I will advertise a bit about myself. The goal of this project is to build a website that employers can use to learn more about me, and for me to apply my knowledge and skills of Node, Express, HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. 

How it works
- Right now it is completely static, but sitting on a functional Node/Express framework if I want to make it dynamic in the future.
- Front-end made with Bootstrap and custom HTMl/CSS. 
- Mostly responsive (with exception to the cards at the moment), working to get 100% responsive.
